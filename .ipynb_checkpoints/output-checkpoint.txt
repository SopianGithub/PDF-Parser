SORE THROAT/HOARSENESS, A-1 
 
A sore throat is often due to a viral infection.  Bacterial infections and other causes need 
to also be considered. 
 
Red Flags. If the Soldier presents with any of the red flags, immediately 
disposition the Soldier as “Provider Now.” One-sided severe sore throat with fever, 
trouble swallowing as shown by drooling, uvula displacement, hoarseness (hot potato 
voice), trismus (lock jaw), and enlarged, tender tonsils are signs of a deep neck space 
infection like a peritonsillar abscess. Shortness of breath and stridor are signs of upper 
airway obstruction due to severe pharyngeal inflammation. 
 
DP1. Symptoms greater than 10 days, immunosuppression, inhaled steroid medications 
are related to diseases that are unlikely to go away without treatment. Hoarseness 
longer than two weeks requires a full laryngeal exam. 
 
DP2. Four questions that look at the chance of having a Group A Streptococcal (GAS) 
infection. If three of the questions are positive, there is 32% chance of having GAS and 
a rapid antigen test (RADT) should be performed. The RADT is effective for ruling out 
GAS in adults but some Soldiers with GAS are missed. Culture test is performed when 
the RADT is negative and Soldiers or their contacts are at higher risk for complications 
from a GAS infection. Culture generally takes 24-48 hours for the results to return. 
TREATMENT PROTOCOL, A-1 
Other protocols. Sore throat and hoarseness that are associated with a virus should be 
treated with minor-care. The other symptoms should be treated according to their 
associated protocols. See COVID-19 L-13.  
 
MCP for sore throat. A sore throat is often due to a viral infection. Minor-care consist of 
pain control, measures to decrease inflammation, getting plenty of rest and drinking 
plenty of fluids (water). Return for signs of the infection getting worse or progressing. 
 
MCP for hoarseness. Hoarseness is often due to a virus or irritant. Minor-care consists 
of resting the vocal cords and avoidance of irritants (cigarette smoking, yelling, 
heartburn, post-nasal drip). This is a good opportunity to discuss the negative effects of 
tobacco use and encourage the Soldier to quit using tobacco, if applicable.
